**Univariate Time Series:** Time Series that consists of single observations recorded sequentially over equal time increments. (Single column in pandas dataframe)

**Multivariate Time Series:** Time Series that consists of more than one observations recorded sequentially over equal time increments. (Multiple columns in pandas dataframe)

| Univarite | Multivariate |
| ----- | ----- |
| Single observation | Multiple observations |

We're going to use the historical Bitcoin price data and Bitcoin block reward size as our dataset.
